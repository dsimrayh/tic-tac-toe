Player object contains name, score, marker, and currentTurn.

Gameboard object contains all elements on page
    - gb array should be rendered to the page
    - contains 'render' function that is called
      after each move (fill board)
    - should be able to update board only through
      player clicks or restart

Controller allows for game logic and flow
    - start sets currentTurn true for X and false for O
    - once a click is made, currentTurn is set to !currentTurn
    - click calls gameboard.placeMarker(), render(), and checkForWin()
    - If win, winner is displayed above gameboard
    - restart sets both scores to 0 and gives option to change names
    - gameInProgress property


// Where to store the gameboard render function?
         - gameBoard *probably render and add event listeners here*
         - gameController
         - displayController
